On Apple devices some installed fonts contain the Apple logo at this position. However,
it is [not recommended](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/OSX/unicode_apple_logo.html) to
use it in this way, since people with other operating systems will most probably not
see this character.

The [ConScript Unicode Registry suggests](http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html)
to use this codepoint for the Klingon Mummification Glyph. This encoding has
been endorsed by the [Klingon Language Institute](http://www.kli.org/).
