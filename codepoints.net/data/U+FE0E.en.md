This codepoint may change the appearance of the preceding character. If that
is a symbol, dingbat or emoji, U+FE0E forces it to be rendered in a textual
fashion as compared to a colorful image. The Unicode standard [defines some
standardized variants](http://www.unicode.org/Public/7.0.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.html).
See also [“Unicode symbol as text or emoji”](http://mts.io/2015/04/21/unicode-symbol-render-text-emoji/)
