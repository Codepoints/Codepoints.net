The Object Replacement Character is used as placeholder in situations, where
some object should sit, that cannot be represented in plain text. For example,
if you copy a text snippet with an embedded image from a web page to a text
editor like Notepad or Vim, the clipboard might choose to replace the image
with U+FFFC in the text content.
