## How to Contribute Content?

Hello there and thank you for your interest!

If you feel a codepoint is missing relevant content, you can add it here. You
need a GitHub account.

### Add Data via Web

1. Navigate to [github.com/Codepoints/.../data](https://github.com/Codepoints/Codepoints.net/tree/master/codepoints.net/data)

2. Click the small “+” in the line below the header<br>
    ![Screenshot where to click](http://i.imgur.com/QthNPnX.png)

3. As filename use "U+", the hex value of the codepoint, the language (“en” for english) and `.md` as file extension, for example:
    * `U+0067.en.md` → codepoint U+0067 (small “g”), english information
    * `U+1F675.de.md` → codepoint “Swash Ampersand”, german information

4. Add your content in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax

5. Commit the file below, add a short description of what you added and which codepoint is involved. Finish with clicking “Propose new file”.

### Add Data via Command Line

Clone `https://github.com/Codepoints/Codepoints.net` via web interface. Then you can do this:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Codepoints.net codepoints.net

$ cd codepoints.net/codepoints.net/data

$ editor U+0067.en.md # make sure to follow the above naming convention
